# CS106B C++ LEGS

## This is a Assignment of *CS106B 2024 Win*

### Here it is – the first programming assignment of the quarter! This assignment is a mix of coding, testing, and debugging tasks that get you practicing with the C++ language and development tools.

The code you are to write uses expressions, control structures, functions, and string processing. Your prerequisite work means you should be familiar with these concepts; the novelty comes in figuring how to take what you already know and translate into the curious new world of C++. You also will build familiarity with the development tools we use and be introduced to strategies for testing and debugging your code. By the time you've completed the assignment, you'll be more comfortable working in C++ and ready to start building larger projects, or as we like to say, you'll have gotten your C++ legs under you! (apologies for the bad pun…)


This assignment is to be completed individually. Working in pairs/groups is not permitted.


## Learning goals
1.To become comfortable using Qt Creator to edit, build, run, and debug simple C++ programs.
2.To practice writing C++ functions that manipulate numbers and strings.
3.To learn basic use of the SimpleTest framework for unit tests and time trials.


## Assignment parts


This assignment consists of two parts. Click on the links below for the full instructions.


- ### [Perfect Numbers](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1244/assignments/1-cpp/perfect)
is a warmup exercise involving number theory, algorithms, and optimization. It gives you a guided transition into C++ and the testing and debugging tools we use. You can start on this task right away — and we recommend doing so! Completing the warmup in the first few days reserves the better part of the week for the bigger second part.
- ### [Soundex Search](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1244/assignments/1-cpp/soundex)
is a complete program that demonstrates a nifty algorithm for matching and grouping names based on their pronunciation. This program uses C++ strings, console I/O, and the `Vector` class. There is a substantial chunk of code for you to write, so get an early start to give yourself sufficient time to work through issues and reach out for help if you hit any snags.
